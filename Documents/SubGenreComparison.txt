Realtime

+ Direct reaction to enemy skills (reaction-based)
+ Rarely seen in the play store
+ Can be more epic in feeling, if situation was handled well or shit goes down

- Direct targeting in action can feel iffy
- Finger can be over ongoing action
- A lot of micro management with the healer
- Hard situations are hard, because they're stressful

Turn-based

+ No chaos on the screen and easier to display a clear playing field on mobile
+ No auto attacks and therefore clear actions (only base and special skills) more readable
+ No weird positioning/targeting
+ 

Realtime with Pause (Command Phase)
